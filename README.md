# Multi-Layer Algorithmic Trading System

A quantitative trading platform that combines technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and sentiment analysis through a layered architecture for robust stock market decision-making.

## Overview

This system implements a multi-factor approach to algorithmic trading, using distinct analytical layers that can adapt to different market conditions. Unlike single-strategy systems, this layered approach provides:

- **Dynamic Signal Weighting**: Adjusts strategy based on market volatility
- **Risk Management**: Multiple exit triggers and position sizing controls  
- **Scalability**: Add new analytical layers without rebuilding core infrastructure
- **Market Adaptability**: Performs across different market regimes

### Core Components

- **Backend API**: Flask-based trading engine with database persistence
- **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based portfolio monitoring and control interface
- **Analysis Framework**: Multi-layer signal processing and recommendation engine
- **Execution Engine**: Alpaca Markets integration for trade execution

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Alpaca Markets account (for live/paper trading)
- Git

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ **(Completed)**

Basic signal processing and infrastructure:

```python
basic_layers = {
    'universe': 'all non-penny-stock NASDAQ and NYSE equities',
    'signals': ['SMA crossover', 'RSI', 'Volume'],
    'timeframe': '6 months daily data',
    'risk': 'Simple stop losses'
}
```

### Phase 2: Enhancement ‚úÖ **(Completed)**

Enhanced technical analysis with multiple indicators:

```python
enhanced_layers = {
    'universe': 'Sector-balanced screening',
    'signals': ['MACD', 'Bollinger Bands', 'Momentum'],
    'timeframe': '1 year + intraday for entries',
    'risk': 'Position sizing, correlation limits'
}

technical_signal_weights = {
    'sma_crossover': 0.22,
    'rsi_signal': 0.18,
    'macd_signal': 0.18,
    'bollinger_signal': 0.14,

```

### Phase 3: Advanced üöß **(In Progress)**

Multi-factor approach with fundamental analysis:

```python
advanced_layers = {
    'universe': 'Dynamic screening with fundamental filters',
    'signals': ['Technical', 'Fundamental', 'Sentiment'],
    'timeframe': '2+ years multi-timeframe',
    'risk': 'Portfolio-level risk management'
}

fundamental_weights = {
    'pe_ratio': 0.20,
    'rev_growth': 0.15,
    'earnings_growth': 0.18,
    'roe_signal': 0.15,
    'debt_to_equity;': 0.12,
    'pb_ratio': 0.12,
    'current_ratio': 0.08 
}
```

## Data Requirements

### Fundamental Layer
- **Financial Statements**: 2+ years quarterly earnings
- **Ratios**: P/E, P/B, ROE, debt-to-equity, current ratio
- **Growth Metrics**: Revenue and earnings growth rates

### Sentiment Layer
- **Analyst Ratings**: Real-time + 1 year historical
- **Options Flow**: Current day + 30-day history  
- **News Sentiment**: Real-time news feeds

### Risk Management Layer
- **Correlations**: 1+ year daily returns for correlation analysis
- **Volatility**: 6+ months for volatility calculations
- **Market Regime**: 2+ years for regime detection

## System Design

### Signal Weighting Strategy

The system dynamically adjusts signal weights based on market conditions:

```python
def adjust_weights_by_market_regime(current_signals, market_vol):
    """Adjust signal weights based on market volatility regime"""
    if market_vol > 30:  # High volatility regime
        return {
            'technical': 0.5,    # Favor technical signals
            'fundamental': 0.3,  # Reduce fundamental weight
            'sentiment': 0.2
        }
    else:  # Low volatility regime
        return {
            'technical': 0.3,
            'fundamental': 0.5,  # Favor fundamental analysis
            'sentiment': 0.2
        }
```

### Entry/Exit Logic
- **Entry Signals**: Require agreement from 2+ analytical layers
- **Exit Signals**: Any layer can trigger (risk management priority)
- **Position Sizing**: Based on signal conviction + risk assessment

## Expected Performance

| Metric | Single Strategy | Layered Approach |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Win Rate** | ~60% | 70%+ |
| **Volatility** | High | Smoother returns |
| **Robustness** | Market dependent | Multi-regime adaptability |
| **Drawdown Control** | Limited | Multiple exit triggers |
| **Scalability** | Requires rebuilding | Incremental layer addition |

### Key Advantages
- **Cross-Market Robustness**: Adapts to different market conditions
- **Enhanced Risk Control**: Multiple exit triggers and portfolio constraints
- **Modular Architecture**: Add new strategies without system redesign
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Real-time weight adjustment based on market regime
