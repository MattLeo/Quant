# Implementation Architecture

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) (Phase completed)

Start with basic layers to establish the core framework:

```python
# Basic implementation structure
basic_layers = {
    'universe': 'all non-penny-stock NASDAQ and NYSE equities',
    'signals': ['SMA crossover', 'RSI', 'Volume'],
    'timeframe': '6 months daily data',
    'risk': 'Simple stop losses'
}
```

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)

Add more sophisticated signal processing:

```python
# Enhanced signal processing
enhanced_layers = {
    'universe': 'Sector-balanced screening',
    'signals': ['MACD', 'Bollinger Bands', 'Momentum'],
    'timeframe': '1 year + intraday for entries',
    'risk': 'Position sizing, correlation limits'
}

enhanced_technical_signal_weights = {
    'sma_crossover' = 0.22,
    'rsi_signal' = 0.18,
    'macd_signal' = 0.18,
    'bollinger_signal' = 0.14,
    'stochastic_signal' = 0.15,
    'volume_signal' = 0.13
}
```

## Phase 3: Advanced (Months 2-3)

Implement full multi-factor approach:

```python
# Advanced multi-factor implementation
advanced_layers = {
    'universe': 'Dynamic screening with fundamental filters',
    'signals': ['Technical', 'Fundamental', 'Sentiment'],
    'timeframe': '2+ years multi-timeframe',
    'risk': 'Portfolio-level risk management'
}

fundamental_weights = {
    'pe_ratio_signal': 0.25,      # Value assessment
    'revenue_growth': 0.25,       # Growth momentum  
    'earnings_growth': 0.20,      # Profitability trend
    'roe_signal': 0.15,           # Efficiency
    'debt_ratio': 0.15            # Financial health
}
```


## Data Requirements by Layer

### Technical Layer
- **Minimum**: 6 months daily OHLCV
- **Optimal**: 2 years daily + 3 months intraday
- **Indicators**: Price, volume, volatility metrics

### Fundamental Layer
- **Quarterly earnings**: 2+ years historical data
- **Financial ratios**: P/E, P/B, ROE, debt ratios
- **Growth metrics**: Revenue/earnings growth rates

### Sentiment Layer
- **Analyst ratings**: Real-time + 1 year history
- **Options flow**: Current day + 30-day history
- **News sentiment**: Real-time feeds

### Risk Layer
- **Correlations**: 1+ year daily returns
- **Volatility**: 6 months minimum
- **Market regime**: 2+ years for regime detection

## Key Design Decisions

### Signal Weighting Strategy

Dynamic weighting based on market conditions:

```python
def adjust_weights_by_market_regime(current_signals, market_vol):
    """
    Adjust signal weights based on market volatility regime
    """
    if market_vol > 30:  # High volatility regime
        return {
            'technical': 0.5,    # More weight on technical signals
            'fundamental': 0.3,  # Less on fundamental signals
            'sentiment': 0.2
        }
    else:  # Low volatility regime
        return {
            'technical': 0.3,
            'fundamental': 0.5,  # More weight on fundamentals
            'sentiment': 0.2
        }
```

### Entry/Exit Timing
- **Entries**: Require 2+ layers agreeing
- **Exits**: Any layer can trigger (risk management priority)
- **Position sizing**: Based on conviction + risk assessment

## Expected Performance Benefits

| Metric | Single Strategy | Layered Approach |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Win Rate** | ~60% | 70%+ |
| **Volatility** | High | Smoother returns |
| **Robustness** | Market dependent | Works across conditions |
| **Drawdown Control** | Limited | Multiple exit triggers |
| **Scalability** | Requires rebuilding | Add layers incrementally |

### Key Advantages
- **Robustness**: Works across different market conditions
- **Drawdown Control**: Multiple exit triggers provide better risk management
- **Scalability**: Add new layers without rebuilding existing infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic weight adjustment based on market regime
